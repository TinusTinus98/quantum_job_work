By harnessing such natural behavior, quantum computers can run new types of algorithms to process information more holistically. They may one day lead to revolutionary breakthroughs in materials and drug discovery, the optimization of complex manmade systems, and artificial intelligence. We expect them to open doors that we once thought would remain locked indefinitely.

Reasons could include: the employer is not accepting applications, is not actively hiring, or is reviewing applications",,"Secure communication technologies are the backbone of today’s digital economy. However, the security of many of the cryptographic tools used today is threatened by the advent of the quantum computer. A quantum computer will be able to solve efficiently some of the mathematical problems which are the basis of today's public key cryptography. This has stimulated great interest in developing new cryptographic techniques with security based on quantum physics, rather than difficult mathematical problems, and which will therefore remain secure in the quantum era.

Quantum communications is a rapidly maturing technology that solves this problem by distributing secret digital keys using quantum light. As a frontier technology, quantum communications is inherently multidisciplinary. This requires the careful fusion of quantum physics, high-speed electronics, low-loss photonics and high-performance software to generate, manipulate and measure light.

While quantum communications has already been successfully deployed to many optical networks worldwide, this has always employed “standard” single-mode telecommunication fibre. Recently, there has been great progress in the development of next-generation optical fibres, using novel physical designs to achieve very different optical guidance characteristics. Such geometries include hollow-core and few-mode fibres, which offer many advantages for optical communications. This enables, for example, spatial division multiplexing to enhance the classical data-carrying capacity of fibre and reduction of nonlinear and dispersive effects, as well as reduced latency.

Reasons could include: the employer is not accepting applications, is not actively hiring, or is reviewing applications",,"Quantum communication is based on encoding information on single photons transmitted over optical networks. The technique provides a way of distributing secret digital keys on optical networks that can subsequently be used for encrypting and authenticating data. Although the practicality of quantum communications has been demonstrated in several field trials, the range of the technique is limited to several hundred kilometres by attenuation in optical fibres. This has stimulated an interest in quantum communications between orbiting satellites and optical ground stations, as a means to extend quantum communication networks to global scale.

Demonstrations of free space quantum communications have thus far been limited to relatively low bit rates, compared to their terrestrial counterparts. This has in part been due to difficulties in modulating near infra-red components at high rates. This project will study techniques for increasing the secure key rate to approach the Mb/s values found for fibre optic systems. This will require increasing the modulation rate of lasers and modulators and reducing the timing jitter of single photon detectors.

The PhD candidate will develop QKD hardware for satellite-based QKD, in collaboration with researchers from Toshiba Europe Limited and Heriot Watt University. Particular attention will be given to the development of optimized devices for quantum random number generation and free-space quantum key distribution transmission. The candidate will implement innovative schemes for information encoding at different wavelengths, assemble devices using discrete optics and participate to the development of the control electronics. The optics to decode the encoded pulses may also be developed in the scope of the PhD project.

The candidates should hold (or expect) a first degree (min grade 2.1) in Physics, Electronic Engineering or other relevant discipline and should have solid background in optics, quantum physics and statistics.",

Job summary
The Amazon Web Services (AWS) Center for Quantum Computing (CQC) in Pasadena, CA, is looking to hire an Equipment Engineer who will aid in AWS’s effort to bring cloud quantum computing services to its worldwide customer base. The candidate will work in a cleanroom environment, alongside research scientists and process engineers, keeping complex semiconductor fabrication and characterization equipment in working order. Responsibilities include interacting with vendors during the installation of equipment and the scheduling of occasional repairs, troubleshooting equipment-related issues, performing preventative maintenance and calibrations, and making self-guided & team-guided improvements to the lab infrastructure. The facility is focused on research and development, which utilizes equipment ranging from ICP-RIE etchers, to various material deposition tools, to advanced characterization instruments, most of which are classified as vacuum systems. The candidate will evaluate and develop procedures that provide maximum tool up-time for wafer processing and characterization while maintaining the equipment at optimal performance. Candidates must have a demonstrated background in fundamental engineering principles and must have excellent problem solving and communication skills. Successful candidates will have prior experience working in an academic or industrial fabrication facility, or similar. Working effectively within a team environment is critical.

Work/Life Balance
At the AWS Center for Quantum Computing, we understand that developing quantum computing technology is a marathon, not a sprint. The work/life integration within our team encourages a culture where employees work hard and also have ownership over their downtime.

Mentorship & Career Growth
We are committed to the growth and development of every member of the CQC. The candidate will receive management and mentorship from within the team that is geared toward career growth, and also have the opportunity to participate in Amazon's mentorship programs for engineers and scientists. By working closely with quantum research scientists, you will have opportunities to learn about quantum computing technology.

Inclusive and Diverse Culture
The AWS CQC is intentional about attracting, developing, and retaining amazing talent from diverse backgrounds in order to build a world-class team. With Quantum being a new and growing initiative within AWS, you would have an opportunity to make an impact on our budding team culture.

Key job responsibilities
An Equipment Engineer troubleshoots problems with equipment and other lab infrastructure, then devises and documents the solutions such that the problems can be more easily solved the next time they occur. When necessary, the Equipment Engineer works with engineers from the company that manufactured the equipment, scheduling service calls and supervising & documenting those engineers' work in our labs. The Equipment Engineer is responsible for improving the up-time of equipment, which involves developing and executing better preventative maintenance plans, devising new mechanisms for tracking parts and service, performing equipment calibrations, and obsessing over the details of the equipment such that it can operate at peak performance. The Equipment Engineer assists with the development and implementation of custom hardware modifications and new lab upgrades. The Equipment Engineer has ownership of equipment and lab spaces and is responsible for the reliable, excellent performance of our labs and everything that operates within it.

A day in the life
The equipment engineer performs a daily morning lab walkthrough to assess the state of the lab and equipment. New problems are identified, documented and assigned to the engineers who have ownership of the affected equipment. Based on priorities set by the team, the engineer works on solving new problems or existing problems from the previous day. Preventative maintenance checks and/or calibrations are performed according to a schedule. When time permits and there aren't problems to solve that are acutely limiting team productivity, projects centered around the improvement of equipment and lab spaces are worked on and implemented. In all aspects of the work, documentation of notes, procedures, fixes, and projects is pivotal. The engineer's goal is to maximize equipment up-time and performance so their teammates can operate the equipment reliably and the whole team can deliver fabricated devices for quantum computing experiments.

About the team
Our team is comprised of scientists and engineers who are building hardware that enables quantum computing technologies. Doing that requires the fabrication of quantum devices, which necessitates the operation of a suite of fabrication and characterization equipment. Equipment Engineers work to maintain and improve the equipment – and the labs in which the equipment is installed – and work alongside Process Engineers and Research Scientists to help deliver fabricated devices for quantum computing experiments.
BASIC QUALIFICATIONS
• Bachelor degree or equivalent in mechanical engineering, materials science or a related field
• 1+ years of work experience in one of the above fields, or similar
• Experience with maintaining and servicing fabrication and/or characterization equipment
• Experience using common lab tools for troubleshooting (e.g., multimeters, oscilloscopes, etc.)
PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS
