	<tr><td>The atomic, molecular, and optical physics group (AMO) at the University of Oklahoma invites applications for two Dodge Family Postdoctoral Research Fellows. One position will be in experiment and the other in theory. These postdoctoral research fellow hires are done alongside a hire for a Dodge Family Research Scientist position. Current AMO research thrusts include the study of ultracold atoms and molecules, quantum optics, matter wave interferometry, quantum information science and entanglement, quantum computing, precision spectroscopy, light-matter interactions, quantum enhanced sensing, few- and many-body physics, and the study of exotic bosonic and fermionic many-body phases with particular interest and effort toward realizing and understanding models relevant to condensed matter physics (see <a href="http://www.ou.edu/cas/physics-astronomy/research/atomic-molecular-and-optical-physics" >http://www.ou.edu/cas/physics-astronomy/research/atomic-molecular-and-optical-physics</a>). The AMO efforts are integral to the Center for Quantum Research and Technology (CQRT, see ou.edu/cqrt). The AMO group enjoys institutional access to the OSCER supercomputer and the OU clean room. The group is housed in Lin Hall, which was completed in 2018 and has more than 18,000 square feet of research laboratory space. Lin Hall meets NIST-A requirements on vibrations, temperature and humidity, as well as electromagnetic interference. <p />

The Dodge Family Postdoctoral Research Fellows will be working with existing faculty on research topics of mutual interest. We strongly encourage applicants to indicate in their cover letter and research statement any collaborations they hope to develop with existing faculty. While not required, we encourage potential applicants to reach out to existing AMO faculty to discuss potential research projects (Eric Abraham: abe@ou.edu, Grant Biedermann: biedermann@ou.edu, Doerte Blume: doerte.blume-1@ou.edu, Robert Lewis-Swan: lewisswan@ou.edu, Alberto Marino: marino@ou.edu, Arne Schwettmann: schwettmann@ou.edu, and Bihui Zhu: bihui.zhu@ou.edu). <p />

Applicants must have a Ph.D. in Physics or related area. The initial appointment is for two years, with the possibility of renewal for a third year, contingent on satisfactory performance and continued funding. The start date for the appointment is flexible, with appointments starting as early as August 1, 2022. Applicants are asked to indicate their potential start date in the application. The stipend will be $60,000 per year plus benefits, along with $5,000 for a computer/laptop and an annual $5,000 travel budget for the Fellow.<p />

To apply, please upload a cover letter, curriculum vitae (including publications), and statement of research interests and plans (up to two pages) to <a href="http://apply.interfolio.com/102407" >http://apply.interfolio.com/102407</a>. As part of the upload, you will be asked to provide the contact info for three letter writers; the letter writers will subsequently be invited to upload their confidential recommendation letter through interfolio.  <p />

Applications received by March 15, 2022 will receive full consideration. We are committed to building a culturally diverse educational environment and strongly encourage members from underrepresented minority groups and women to apply.<p />
