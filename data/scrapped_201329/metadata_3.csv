Reasons could include: the employer is not accepting applications, is not actively hiring, or is reviewing applications",,"Secure communication technologies are the backbone of today’s digital economy. However, the security of many of the cryptographic tools used today is threatened by the advent of the quantum computer. A quantum computer will be able to solve efficiently some of the mathematical problems which are the basis of today's public key cryptography. This has stimulated great interest in developing new cryptographic techniques with security based on quantum physics, rather than difficult mathematical problems, and which will therefore remain secure in the quantum era.

Quantum communications is a rapidly maturing technology that solves this problem by distributing secret digital keys using quantum light. As a frontier technology, quantum communications is inherently multidisciplinary. This requires the careful fusion of quantum physics, high-speed electronics, low-loss photonics and high-performance software to generate, manipulate and measure light.

While quantum communications has already been successfully deployed to many optical networks worldwide, this has always employed “standard” single-mode telecommunication fibre. Recently, there has been great progress in the development of next-generation optical fibres, using novel physical designs to achieve very different optical guidance characteristics. Such geometries include hollow-core and few-mode fibres, which offer many advantages for optical communications. This enables, for example, spatial division multiplexing to enhance the classical data-carrying capacity of fibre and reduction of nonlinear and dispersive effects, as well as reduced latency. Novel types of fibres could also offer many benefits for quantum communications, which this project will explore in detail.

This project is funded by a 4 year EPSRC Industrial CASE PhD Studentship and is a collaboration between Toshiba Europe Limited and the University of Cambridge.

The technique provides a way of distributing secret digital keys on optical networks that can subsequently be used for encrypting and authenticating data. Although the practicality of quantum communications has been demonstrated in several field trials, the range of the technique is limited to several hundred kilometres by attenuation in optical fibres. This has stimulated an interest in quantum communications between orbiting satellites and optical ground stations, as a means to extend quantum communication networks to global scale.

Demonstrations of free space quantum communications have thus far been limited to relatively low bit rates, compared to their terrestrial counterparts. This has in part been due to difficulties in modulating near infra-red components at high rates. This project will study techniques for increasing the secure key rate to approach the Mb/s values found for fibre optic systems. This will require increasing the modulation rate of lasers and modulators and reducing the timing jitter of single photon detectors.

The PhD candidate will develop QKD hardware for satellite-based QKD, in collaboration with researchers from Toshiba Europe Limited and Heriot Watt University. Particular attention will be given to the development of optimized devices for quantum random number generation and free-space quantum key distribution transmission. The candidate will implement innovative schemes for information encoding at different wavelengths, assemble devices using discrete optics and participate to the development of the control electronics. The optics to decode the encoded pulses may also be developed in the scope of the PhD project.

The candidates should hold (or expect) a first degree (min grade 2.1) in Physics, Electronic Engineering or other relevant discipline and should have solid background in optics, quantum physics and statistics.",,www.indeed.com

The equipment engineer performs a daily morning lab walkthrough to assess the state of the lab and equipment. New problems are identified, documented and assigned to the engineers who have ownership of the affected equipment. Based on priorities set by the team, the engineer works on solving new problems or existing problems from the previous day. Preventative maintenance checks and/or calibrations are performed according to a schedule. When time permits and there aren't problems to solve that are acutely limiting team productivity, projects centered around the improvement of equipment and lab spaces are worked on and implemented. In all aspects of the work, documentation of notes, procedures, fixes, and projects is pivotal. The engineer's goal is to maximize equipment up-time and performance so their teammates can operate the equipment reliably and the whole team can deliver fabricated devices for quantum computing experiments.

About the team
Our team is comprised of scientists and engineers who are building hardware that enables quantum computing technologies. Doing that requires the fabrication of quantum devices, which necessitates the operation of a suite of fabrication and characterization equipment.
