Primary Purpose Of Organizational Unit

Our primary mission is providing instruction of the highest quality in physics and astronomy to undergraduate and graduate students at UNC -CH. Training in physics is fundamental among the natural sciences because it provides understanding of the forces governing the structure of matter, from subatomic particles to the large-scale structure of the universe.

Our departmental instructional mission spans all segments of the student community. Over 60% of all college graduates from UNC -CH have taken a course in our department. Among them: undergraduate liberal arts majors who should master the power of quantitative reasoning; undergraduates seeking a degree in another of the natural sciences, who need physics as a foundation for their advanced scientific training; the small number of undergraduates who major in physics, to whom we provide broad and rigorous training. Our graduate education and research advances frontiers of knowledge at the two extremes of space and time, from the very small) the realm of particle physics) to the very large (the realm of astronomy, while expanding the boundaries of knowledge in the many subfields spanning length scales between. Forefront physics and astronomy research requires access to well-equipped laboratories and extensive computing capabilities; it also must be supported by comprehensive and accessible library collections. Again, in research at this advanced level, the bridging aspect of physics provides basic interdisciplinary insight for many other sciences.

This instructional mission is supported by a strong managerial, administrative, and technical staff. Duties of these employees range from budget planning and management for the numerous research grants held by faculty in the department to maintaining course and student records. These activities are usually accomplished in a standard 40- hour week schedule.

Position Summary

The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Physics and Astronomy Department has an immediate opening for a postdoctoral researcher position in experimental nuclear and astroparticle physics (http://enapphysics.web.unc.edu/). The group’s primary research activities are searching for neutrinoless double-beta decay in 76Ge as part of the LEGEND Collaboration, a direct search for neutrino mass in the KATRIN tritium beta-decay neutrino mass experiment, and involvement in the liquid scintillator R&D experiment NuDot. We are also participants in the NSF PIRE -GErmanium Materials And Detectors Advancement Research Consortium (http://pire.gemadarc.org/) where we are working with GEMADARC collaborators on advanced Ge detectors.

The UNC group is a leading contributor to the LEGEND collaboration, with major roles in detector development and characterization, electronics readout and data acquisition, and software and analysis development activities. We are heavily involved in constructing and commissioning the first phase of this experiment, LEGEND -200, which aims to start data taking in 2022, while heavily invested in planning for LEGEND -1000, a next-generation ton-scale experiment. In KATRIN we are responsible for data acquisition and are exploring quantum sensor techniques to enhance KATRIN’s ultimate sensitivity. We also lead the NuDot Experiment, a 500-kg detector that will be housed at Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory ( TUNL ) starting in 2022.

Our UNC group is an integral part of the Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory (http://www.tunl.duke.edu/), a Department of Energy Office of Nuclear Physics Center of Excellence, which provides substantial technical and scientific resources related to our activities. We are also affiliated with the Institute for Cosmology, Subatomic Matter, and Symmetries (CoSMS) (https://cosms.unc.edu/) that offers a stimulating environment for discussions on a broad range of fundamental physics and astronomy topics.

This position provides the opportunity to work closely with a strong group of graduate and undergraduate students, other postdoctoral fellows, our scientific and engineering staff, as well as our TUNL and CoSMS colleagues. Chapel Hill is consistently ranked as one of the best places to live in America, where one finds a small-town culture with metropolitan amenities. The town is walkable, eclectic, safe, affordable, diverse and green. Residents enjoy the temperate weather and the easy access to activities in the Triangle, on the coast and in the mountains.

Quantum Information Science (QIS) is an emerging field that has the potential to cause revolutionary advances in many areas of science and engineering, and nations around the world are vying for dominance in the field, which is also one of the most urgent tasks DOE faces to make sure the U.S. wins the quantum race. In 2019, NETL developed strategies to establish and maintain QIS competency and to explore QIS applications in fossil energy. With a seed project, in 2020, under Sensors & Controls, NETL developed a new task on quantum sensing for energy applications. The objective of this task is to use quantum sensing materials, quantum optics, quantum computing, and quantum sensing methodologies for realizing unprecedented performance in advanced sensing instrumentation for high priority fossil energy applications (such as identifying high value rare-earth elements (REEs) in coal and coal by-products, cybersecurity of energy infrastructure, hybrid quantum-classical optical fiber network, etc.), with at least an order of magnitude improvement as compared to classical counterparts within acceptable costs. In order to speed up NETL quantum sensing capability development, a collaborator is needed to fulfill learning objectives/goals.
The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The appointment is full-time at NETL in Pittsburgh, PA. This is an educational opportunity offered by NETL and administered by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education. Participants in the program are not considered employees of NETL, DOE, ORISE, or any other office or agency.
The learning objectives for this educational opportunity will be to expand upon the state-of-the-art concepts of developing NETL quantum sensing technology for energy applications. The selected participant will contribute targeted information to the NETL quantum sensing team to enhance the quantum sensing capability in response to the Sensors & Controls program's goal of realizing unprecedented performance in advanced sensing instrumentation for high priority fossil energy applications. The participant will have opportunities to give presentations at scientific conferences, conduct literature review & discussion with team members, participate in NETL biweekly project progress team meetings, present updates, and to provide information and suggestions to the team members, and help develop near-term goals of this task based on progress made by team members.

The business also has a very healthy attitude to working-from-home with flexibility in working hours. Personally, I was hired with a focus on CI and PTW which is an incredibly dynamic and creative part of the business – no two bids are the same and nor are the appropriate methods for tackling the problem. CI / PTW at Raytheon UK has benefited from continuous improvement of its methods and, in my personal experience, the BD graduates are trusted with a high degree of responsibly and freedom to explore new methods. During my time I have developed a novel method for assessing competitors and brought my own experience of OSINT techniques to bear in meaningful business winning decisions. If solving disparate and obscure problems, numerical or logical, with the license to fully utilise your own can-do attitude and creative mindset - this role is for you”

Former Graduate CI/PTW Analyst
