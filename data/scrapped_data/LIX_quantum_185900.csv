"Postdocs in Supercontinuum based Mid-Infrared Imaging or Quantum Imaging","DTU - Technical University of Denmark","https://www.linkedin.com/company/technical-university-of-denmark","","","-","Copenhagen, Capital Region, Denmark","If you seek a fantastic academic working environment combined with scientific excellence and want to establish a career as a scientist within supercontinuum based optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging with either focus on mid-infrared OCT or quantum (two-photon interference) OCT, then we have the ideal opportunity for you.
Come and be a part of the new EU Horizon Europe projects (ZDZW, TURBO and SEQUOIA) and one of the world’s strongest groups developing in-house supercontinuum lasers and ultrabroad band OCT sub-surface imaging systems.
Postdoc – Mid infrared OCT (one position): You will develop high resolution mid-infrared OCT imaging systems for industrial defect localization inside wind turbine blades (project TURBO) and ceramic multilayer structures (project ZDZW).
Both projects support the EU Key Strategic Orientation of “Making Europe the first digitally led circular, climate-neutral and sustainable economy” (KSO C).
Postdoc – Quantum OCT (two positions):You will develop time domain and spectral domain quantum OCT (QOCT) imaging for the SEQUOIA project. By exploiting two-photon interference and orbital angular momentum (OAM), you will establish two novel QOCT systems. The project supports the EU Key Strategic Orientation of “Making Europe the first digitally led circular, climate-neutral and sustainable economy” (KSO C).
As a postdoc in our group, you will have the flexibility and liberty to plan your daily work as well as gain a high degree of influence on how to reach the project milestones. You will be joining a dedicated cross-disciplinary team striving to improve human health and tackle global warming. A team embracing studies on supercontinuum lasing, optical fiber fabrication, bacteria and hormone sensing, cancer diagnosis and agricultural spectroscopy.
In our group, we cherish a friendly working environment and knowledge sharing at all levels. This means that we prioritize to support and educate you in the disciplines in which you feel less confident. In addition we take pride in supporting employees who wish to promote their research to entrepreneurship. The latter is realized by our project partnerships and close collaboration with hospitals and industry.
Responsibilities and qualifications Postdoc in mid-infrared OCT (TURB0 and ZDZW projects): Your primary responsibility will be to make a compact and robust mid-infrared OCT imaging system, which operates at a center wavelength of 4µm. This will be done together with the company NORBLIS ApS, where you specifically will be in charge of the optical part and testing of the imaging system on a range of different samples. Once this is completed, you will work on upgrading another OCT system operating at 7µm and implement the concept of spectroscopic OCT. Evaluating the difference in performance between the two state-of-the-art 4µm and 7µm systems in a range of applications will be a key topic that is expected to lead to a significant number of high impact publications.
For this position we seek a strong experimentalist within optics. As an applicant, you could have experience in OCT, microscopy or bench-top optics. In addition you have a personal drive and strive towards high scientific impact.
Postdocs in Quantum OCT:You will in close collaboration with the second postdoc develop two QOCT systems. First a time domain QOCT system with Q-plate enabled OAM and subsequently a Fourier Domain (swept source) QOCT system with spatial light modulator (SLM) enabled OAM. By combining partner developed key components, you will establish the two systems where characterization and imaging ex-vivo retina samples are central responsibilities. With the above goals, we see a large potential for high impact publications. With the close postdoc collaboration, each postdoc will nevertheless have each their dedicated scientific focus:
QOCT postdoc: You will be responsible of experimentally developing the two QOCT systems and documenting the imaging performance.
For this position we seek an individual with an understanding in quantum optics and solid experience in experimental optics. In addition we are looking for person that has an urge to drive scientific results to high scientific impact.
Quantum OAM postdoc: You will responsible of developing a global analytic model for predicting performance metrics of classical OCT and QOCT with/without OAM, both for time and Fourier domain. Secondly, you will experimentally implement Q-plate and SLM enabled OAM entanglement and evaluate performance in the frame of QOCT.
For this position, we seek an individual with a strong understanding either in quantum optics or OAM (or both) and with an urge to drive scientific results to high-impact publications.
Being one of the three postdocs, you will work closely with several companies that either deliver custom hardware, software or implementation expertise for system development. A particular close collaboration will be conducted with the start-up company NORBLIS ApS, marketing mid-infrared supercontinuum lasers and OCT imaging systems.
As a formal qualification, you must hold a PhD degree (or equivalent).

Quantum Metrology Group

Our group has developed an optical atomic clock based on Lu+. Lutetium is a unique clock candidate in that it supports three clock transitions within the one atom enabling rigorous consistency checks on clock performance. We have shown that two of these transitions have very low systematic shifts making them competitive with the best systems in the world. In 2019 we demonstrated the feasibility of operating the clock with multiple ions which will enable improvements in measurement precision. More recently we demonstrated agreement between two clocks at the level of 10-18, which was limited by the measurement statistics and not systematic uncertainty. To provide further advancement in clock performance we are now investigating more practical approaches to multi-ion operation.

Job Description

Practical clock operation with a small array of ions requires an elimination of background collisions which is best achieved in a cryogenic environment. In this project the candidate will be responsible for the design and implementation of a cryogenic ion-trap apparatus. Candidate will work closely with members of the team to determine key design criteria and with external companies in the design of a suitable cryostat system. Candidate will also be expected to have a leadership role in experiments to characterize the system and demonstrate clock operation.

Job Requirements
PhD in experimental Physics/Engineering ideally with expertise in ion-traps and atomic physics.Practical experience with cryogenic systems.Experience with 3D-Cad software such as SolidWorks or Autodesk Inventor.Fluency in written and spoken English.

Quantum Metrology Group

Our group has developed an optical atomic clock based on Lu+. Lutetium is a unique clock candidate in that it supports three clock transitions within the one atom enabling rigorous consistency checks on clock performance. We have shown that two of these transitions have very low systematic shifts making them competitive with the best systems in the world. In 2019 we demonstrated the feasibility of operating the clock with multiple ions which will enable improvements in measurement precision. More recently we demonstrated agreement between two clocks at the level of 10-18, which was limited by the measurement statistics and not systematic uncertainty. To further advance clock performance and develop local expertise in optical clocks, we now looking to establish in-house capabilities in the design and implementation of ultra-stable optical resonators.

Job Description

We currently have a project aimed at improving clock interrogation through improved laser stabilization. In this project the candidate will have a leadership role in the design and implementation of an ultra-stable optical cavity. Design work will involve extensive simulations of mechanical and thermal response of environmental isolation enclosures. It is expected that the candidate will work closely with the laboratory team to better characterize existing cavity setups, and to experimentally demonstrate improved clock performance in a multi-ion clock system.

What our Previous Graduates says, don’t just take our word for it!

“The great thing about being a Graduate is that no two days are the same & you get a real satisfaction of seeing a project through its life-cycle. One day you could be with the team briefing up Senior Leadership about business we are bidding & the next you could be going to a Customer meeting where you're delivering a new product and everything else in between.

I fully relish the responsibility of seeing something through from start to finish, and the people it brings you in contact with. As a PM you are continuously dealing with different colleagues within the multi-functional teams across Raytheon and pulling on their expertise & experiences. I've been given real responsibility with an appropriate amount of direction from my seniors, which resulted real satisfaction of adding value to the day-to-day life of the company.

I really appreciated the opportunities I had while on Raytheon's GLDP. From starting in Airborne Intelligence Business, to an external secondment with the UK Defence Solutions Centre where I represented Raytheon, to my current role within Sensors, specifically the Air Traffic Management Systems. This has resulted in a greater understanding across the different parts of the business and bringing best practices with it.”

One-year post GLDP

“I joined the Raytheon GLDP following my Masters in 2015 in Cyber and Intelligence. Throughout my time on the GLDP I learned how to report on and manage project finances, how to engage with different stakeholder communities, think strategically and adapt quickly to new and daily challenges. I finished the graduate scheme in 2017 and now I’m the Project Manager for a portfolio of 12 projects.

I enjoy being a Project Manager as its challenging, fast paced and every day is different. I get to work with a variety of people, and I enjoy the responsibility and the accountability that comes with the day to day running of a project. I quickly learned that to be a successful Project Manager you had to develop good relationships with colleagues and stakeholders based on mutual trust and respect, be proactive & always embrace new challenges & opportunities whatever they may be.

Working as a Project Manager at Raytheon has been incredibly rewarding & I’m looking forward to developing in my role & finding new ways to improve”.

Job Description

Energetics of Quantum Technologies

With the rise of quantum technologies, the question of their resource consumption is becoming accurate. Oddly enough, the energetic footprint of quantum technologies has remained in a blindspot of national and international quantum strategies and roadmaps. The purpose of this research position is to build a framework to monitor, optimize and mitigate the energy consumption of two pillars of quantum techs: (i) quantum computing and simulation, and (ii) quantum measurement and sensing. These two tightly connected research lines will lead to the definition of new energy-based metrics of performance, and optimize their behavior as a function of the experimental platform, type of code and architecture, and non-classical resources used to compute/measure - providing a new and essential way to benchmark different technological options.

PhD projectThe ICTM-group was established in 2012 at the University of Sussex by Matthias Keller with the intention to investigate and employ the interaction of ions and light and ions with atoms and molecules.This project unites two distinct areas of quantum information processing: single ions stored in radio-frequency traps and single photons in optical fibres. Both fields have seen spectacular advances in recent years. Strings of ions are presently the most successful implementation of quantum computing, with elementary quantum algorithms and quantum simulations realised. Photons, on the other hand are used to distribute entanglement over ever increasing distances.The principal challenge in the field is to enhance quantum processing power by scaling up current devices to larger quantum systems. We are pursuing one of the most promising strategies, distributed quantum computation, in which multiple small-scale ion processors are interlinked by exchanging photonic quantum bits via optical fibres. This requires novel ion trap structures that facilitate high-performance quantum computation and a photonic interconnect for networking. The Ion Trap Cavity-QED and Molecular Physics group in Sussex has a leading role in this field.

We are looking for a highly motivated and ambitious PhD candidate who is interested in research at the frontiers of complex fluids, non-Newtonian Fluid Mechanics, soft matter, bubbles, droplets, and mathematical and computational fluid mechanics.

Short Description Currently, little is known about cavitation bubble dynamics in complex fluids. We are particularly interested in yield-stress fluids, which form a specific class of non-Newtonian fluids that possess a characteristic yield stress below which they may support the imposed external stress elastically but beyond which they no longer act as a solid but rather flow like a viscous fluid. Such viscoplastic behaviour is present in a wide range of soft materials, such as emulsions, foams, detergents, and gels. Cavitation bubble dynamics in such media is relevant in numerous industrial sectors such as additive manufacturing, food industry, cosmetics, and ultrasound-induced degassing and defoaming processes.

The project is highly interdisciplinary and a collaboration between the Institute of Physics (IoP) at the University of Amsterdam and the Multiphase Fluid Dynamics group at the Institute of Fluid Dynamics at ETH, Zurich.

For more information about the Groups, please visit FluidLab, Soft Matter Group, Computational Soft Matter Group, Multiphase Fluid Dynamics, Institute of Fluid Dynamics
